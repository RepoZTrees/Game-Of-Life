Spec for Conway's Game of Life.

1. Initially, there is a grid with some cell which may be alive or dead. Our task is to generate the next generation of cells based on the following rules:
(Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically or diagonally adjacent.)


2. Count the live neighbours:
   - Top Left(TL), Top Right(TR), Bottom Left(BL), and Bottom Right(BR) and center cells (will have three neighbours each)
   - Left Edge(LE), Right Edge(RE), Top Edge(TE), Bottom Edge(BE) (will have five neighbours each)
   - Centre (will have eight neighbours)

3. Game Rules:

   - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under population.
     If a cell is ON and has fewer than two neighbors that are ON, it turns OFF.

   - Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
     If a cell is ON and has eihter two or three neighbors that are ON, it remains ON.

   - Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
     If a cell is ON and has more than three neighbors that are ON, it turns OFF.
     
   - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
     If a cell is OFF and has exactly three neighbors that are ON, it turns ON.

Examples:
0 = .(dead)
1 = *(alive)

The '*' represent an alive cell and the '.' represent a dead cell.

Input: 
Output: .*.
       	.*.
       	.*.
